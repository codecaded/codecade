# codecade

Starting today, I, with the help of my friends, mark the beginning of a new project named CoDecade, whose sole purpose is to build a pool of people and resources, bring together a community of people I want to be with, see, and grow together in the long run, while utilising code, thus the name, Code Decade.

## Welcome to the Resource Pool

Here in three files I would provide data that includes projects by people who are a part of CoDecade, courses would contain the links of all digital courses available online, preferably free, and books would contain the names, and eventually links and pictures of the books that our members have been through in this journey, communication and active participation is the key.

## Things to be aware about

1. Nobody is a pro by birth, so when you come across a query, feel free to question others, and google for the answers, but not with a motive of copying the code, but in an attempt to understand it, most people would be really glad to help you, since they have been through that stage themselves, so they feel when someone asks queries.
2. The more people you know, the better. There is the thing about networking that most people feel is very platonic, but in reality it's about actually connecting on a level that is a win-win situation for all, and that is achieved only by crossing the walls of anxiety.
3. There would always be people who know more than you, and there would always be people who know less than you, the more you ask others for help, and the more you help others, the better for everyone including you. That's how it works, collaboration is the ultimate goal.

# Hello World, we are here, to build, deploy, and enjoy ;)
